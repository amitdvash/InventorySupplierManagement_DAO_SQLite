Overview

The Inventory Management System allows users to manage inventory through two roles: Manager
and Worker. Managers can add products, set discounts, and generate reports, while workers can
manage individual items (adding, moving, removing), and view product details

-----Log in to Inventory Management System-----
Manager:
Full access to inventory management (add products, set discounts, generate reports)
Password: 1111 (Username is irrelevant).

Worker:
Can manage items (add, move, remove) but cannot set discounts or add new products.
Password: 1111 (Username is irrelevant).

----System Initialization----
At the system startup, you are prompted to initialize the system with sample data or begin with
an empty inventory. If sample data is chosen, the system is preloaded with products and items.
Option 1: Initialize with predefined data (Cola, Chips, Milk products).
Option 2: Start with an empty system, allowing you to add new products manually.

----Available Menu Options----
After successful login as either a Manager or a Worker, the system presents different menus
based on the user role.
Manager Menu:

Generate Inventory Report: View detailed reports based on product categories, sub-
categories, or statuses (e.g., products about to expire).

Add Product: Add new products to the inventory.

Set Discount: Apply discounts to a product, category, or sub-category.

Switch to Worker Menu: Allows managers to access the worker-level functionality.

Exit: Exit the system.

----Worker menu----
Add Item: Add individual items to existing products in the inventory.

Remove Item: Remove an item from the inventory.

Move Item: Change the location of an item between store and warehouse.

View Product Details: View details of a specific product.

Exit: Exit the system.

----Important Notes----

Product-Item Relationship: Items can only belong to a product if their name, category, sub-
category, and size are identical. A product is a container for items with matching attributes.

No Persistent Storage: All data is stored in memory and will be reset each time the system is
restarted.
Manager Privileges: Only managers can add products or set discounts, while workers are
limited to managing items within products.
Product First: Before adding items to the inventory, the product must first be added by a
manager. Only after a product exists in the inventory can items be added under it.
